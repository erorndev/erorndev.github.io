      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine sitting down to watch your favorite show, only for the screen to suddenly
be taken over by a image, or different kind of stuff really. This happened more
often than you might think during the era of analog television, thanks to TV hijacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-analog-tv&#34;&gt;What is Analog TV?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analog TV broadcasting uses radio frequency signals (duh) to transmit television content.
These signals were transmitted over airwaves from a broadcast tower to household
antennas or cable systems, usually in a VHF/UHF spectrum. The broadcast signal itself
was relatively easy to intercept or alter compared to today&amp;rsquo;s encrypted digital systems.
The use of analog signals meant that, theoretically, anyone with the right equipment could
capture and modify these transmissions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
