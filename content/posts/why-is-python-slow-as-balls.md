### Introduction
We all know Python, It's one of the simplest and most powerful programming languages in the world.
It’s used in fields like AI (TensorFlow, PyTorch) and Data Science (Pandas, NumPy). It’s simplicity
and readability have made it a favorite for me. However, there is something thats important, **It’s slow**.
But why is it slow? This language has such perfect syntax, but, like everything in life, it comes with downsides.

### Why is it slow?
Python can be slower because of these reasons;

#### Python is Dynamically typed
In Python, you don’t have to tell the computer what type a variable is when you create it. You can just do something 
like x = 10 or y = "Hello", and Python will figure it out on its own. This is called dynamic typing, and it makes 
coding really beginner friendly. For example:
```
x = 10
y = "Hello"
z = x + y  # This will throw a TypeError at runtime
```
Here, Python doesn’t know ahead of time whether x + y even makes sense. So at runtime, it has to check: “Wait, is this addition allowed?” and then it sees it’s not, so it throws an error. In small programs, this extra checking is barely noticeable. But in complex applications, the shitfuck happens.

#### Python is interpreted ( Compiled/Interpreted languages )
The main difference between compiled and interpreted languages is how the computer runs the code.
Compiled languages turn your code into machine code ahead of time, so it can run directly and quickly. Python, being interpreted, runs your code line by line at runtime. This makes it easy to test and flexible, but it adds extra work for the computer, which can slow things down.

#### Python has a Global Interpreter Lock

Python's GIL is another factor that affects its performance. The GIL is a [mutex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)) (its a lock)
that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecodes at a time. This simplifies memory management, but at the same time it leads to 
performance-related issues.

#### Python's Memory Management is not optimized for speed
Python takes care of memory automatically using a garbage collector. This is great because you don’t have to worry about freeing memory yourself, but it does add some overhead. On top of that, Python’s objects are usually bigger than in lower-level languages, so they use more memory and can make programs a bit slower.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, there is 4 things to note about:
1. Dynamic Types
2. Interpreted nature
3. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
4. Memory Management
