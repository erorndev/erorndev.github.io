Imagine sitting down to watch your favorite show, only for the screen to suddenly
be taken over by a image, or different kind of stuff really. This happened more
often than you might think during the era of analog television, thanks to TV hijacking.
What is Analog TV?
Analog TV broadcasting uses radio frequency signals (duh) to transmit television content.
These signals were transmitted over airwaves from a broadcast tower to household
antennas or cable systems, usually in a VHF/UHF spectrum. The broadcast signal itself
was relatively easy to intercept or alter compared to today&rsquo;s encrypted digital systems.
The use of analog signals meant that, theoretically, anyone with the right equipment could
capture and modify these transmissions."><meta name=author content="erorn"><link rel=canonical href=https://erorndev.github.io/www/posts/analog-tv-hijacking/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/www/assets/css/stylesheet.8fe10233a706bc87f2e08b3cf97b8bd4c0a80f10675a143675d59212121037c0.css integrity="sha256-j+ECM6cGvIfy4Is8+XuL1MCoDxBnWhQ2ddWSEhIQN8A=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://erorndev.github.io/www/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://erorndev.github.io/www/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://erorndev.github.io/www/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://erorndev.github.io/www/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://erorndev.github.io/www/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://erorndev.github.io/www/posts/analog-tv-hijacking/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://erorndev.github.io/www/posts/analog-tv-hijacking/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="World Wide Erorn"><meta property="og:title" content="Analog TV Hijacking"><meta property="og:description" content="Introduction Imagine sitting down to watch your favorite show, only for the screen to suddenly be taken over by a image, or different kind of stuff really.

The broadcast signal itself was relatively easy to intercept or alter compared to today’s encrypted digital systems. The use of analog signals meant that, theoretically, anyone with the right equipment could capture and modify these transmissions.\nHow hijackers took over channels To successfully interrupt and take over a channel, The first step was always to find the right frequency. TV channels broadcasted on VHF/UHF bands. Hijackers needed to find the frequency the station was using at that moment, then broadcast on the same frequency to interfere with the regular broadcast. Since analog signals werent encrypted at the time, hijackers could tune into these frequencies with ease, essentially matching the station’s transmission and overriding it with their own signal. Once they found the target frequency, they would need a video transmitter. A video transmitter is responsible for transmitting or broadcasting a connected audio-video device, so they could override their own content. The transmitter would send out the hijacker’s broadcast, and if it was strong enough it would overpower the station’s signal. Causing a hijack.\nExamples of Hijacking cases The Max Headroom Incident (1987) On November 22, 1987, two local TV channels in Chicago were taken over by a masked figure, who appeared on-screen looking like the character Max Headroom. For about 90 seconds, the guy made creepy statements while performing weird gestures. The whole thing was unsettling, and to this day, no one knows who was behind it or why they did it.\nThe “Ghostbusters” Hijack (1986) In the UK, a hacker hijacked a children’s program and flooded the screen with Ghostbusters-themed images and messages. It wasn’t as famous as the Max Headroom incident. It was a little spooky, and probably gave kids nightmares for a while.\nCaptain Midnight Hijacking (1986) It happened on a Sunday evening, during the airing of the popular movie The Falcon and the Snowman on HBO. At around 9:00 PM, the movie was interrupted by a bizarre and unexpected broadcast. The screen suddenly cut to a strange image, a message that read:\nGOODEVENING HBO FROM CAPTAIN MIDNIGHT $12.95 A MONTH? NO WAY! (PREMIUM TV) The broadcast lasted for around 4 minutes. The guys name was MacDougall, a satellite dish installer and electronics expert.
