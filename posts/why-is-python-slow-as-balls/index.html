Its used in fields like AI (TensorFlow, PyTorch) and Data Science (Pandas, NumPy). Its simplicity and readability have made it a favorite for me. However, there is something thats important, Its slow. But why is it slow? This language has such perfect syntax, but, like everything in life, it comes with downsides.\nWhy is it slow? Python is slower than languages like C, Rust, or other low-level languages for a variety of reasons:\nPython is Dynamically typed Dynamic type checking is basically Python’s ability to determine the type of a variable at runtime, rather than requiring you to explicitly declare the type when you define the variable. This makes Python super user-friendly, But it comes at a price. Since Python doesn’t know the type of a variable until runtime, it has to perform additional checks when performing operations. Consider the example below:\nx = 10 y = \"Hello\" z = x + y # This will throw a TypeError at runtime Here, The interpreter will check the types of x and y during execution to determine whether they are compatible for the + operation. This extra step of type resolution can slow things down a lot, especially in larger applications.\nPython is interpreted The difference between compiled and interpreted languages lies in how the code is executed by the machine. In compiled languages like C and Rust, the code is turned to machine code before executiıon, This process is called compiling. This happens once, and the resulting machine code can then be run directly by operating systems. Since python is interpreted, The code is executed line by line by the interpreter at runtime. This step-by-step execution adds significant overhead and is not as fast as executing precompiled machine code.\nPython has a Global Interpreter Lock Python’s GIL is another factor that affects its performance. The GIL is a mutex that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecodes at a time. This simplifies memory management, but at the same time it leads to performance issues.\nPython’s Memory Management is not optimized for speed Python handles memory automatically with garbage collection, which is convenient but slow. Unlike languages like C, where you manage memory yourself, Python’s garbage collector runs in the background to clean up unused memory, causing delays. Plus, Python’s objects tend to be larger than in low-level languages, eating up more memory and slowing things down.\nConclusion In conclusion, there is 4 things to note about:\nDynamic Types Interpreted nature Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) Memory Management ","wordCount":"435","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-08-13T17:41:17.649Z","dateModified":"2025-08-13T17:41:17.649Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"erorn"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://example.org/posts/why-is-python-slow-as-balls/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"World Wide Erorn","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://example.org/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://example.org/ accesskey=h title="World Wide Erorn (Alt + H)">World Wide Erorn</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
